    "# 1473. Paint House III\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that has been painted last summer should not be painted again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color. (For example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods  [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array houses, an m * n matrix cost and an integer target where:\n",
    "\n",
    "houses[i]: is the color of the house i, 0 if the house is not painted yet.\n",
    "cost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j+1.\n",
    "Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods, if not possible return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3\n",
    "Output: 9\n",
    "Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]\n",
    "This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].\n",
    "Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.\n",

    "Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way [2,2,1,2,2]\n",
    "This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. \n",
    "Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.\n",

    "Output: -1\n",
    "Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.\n",
